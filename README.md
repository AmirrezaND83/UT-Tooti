# UT-Tooti
A project from Tehran University - Subject Basics of Programming - C Language

This program was coded in C language using Qt IDLE\n
In order to open it with other applications, you can use .h and .c files and ignore .pro and .pro.user files\n
If you're using Qt to open it, don't forget to configurate the project before any attempt to build or run.\n
These are compilers used to code the project:\n
	\tMinGW 7.3.0 32-bits\n
	\tMinGW 7.3.0 64-bits\n
I recomend using same or higher versions of the same compiler (MinGW) to run the code\n
\n
Good Luck
