This program was coded in C language using Qt IDLE
In order to open it with other applications, you can use .h and .c files and ignore .pro and .pro.user files
If you're using Qt to open it, don't forget to configurate the project before any attempt to build or run.
These are compilers used to code the project:
	MinGW 7.3.0 32-bits
	MinGW 7.3.0 64-bits
I recomend using same or higher versions of the same compiler (MinGW) to run the code

Good Luck
